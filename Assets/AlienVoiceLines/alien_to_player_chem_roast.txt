Your species fears fire; we bathe in boron.
You breathe oxygen; how primitive.
On Zenthar, your haircut is illegal.
Are you trying to cook or just spreading chaos?;Honestly, it's unclear.
I’ve met smarter asteroids.;You might be the exception.
Why do you move like a half-heated burrito?
I've seen oxygen form better ideas than yours.
You’re not from Pluto, are you?;They'd never let you in.
Is that a human technique, or did your limbs glitch?
I admire your confidence; it’s unburdened by competence.
Your posture offends multiple galaxies.

Tell me, does failure come naturally to you?;Or did you train?
You dropped something; it was your usefulness.
You smell like expired radon soup.
You have the charisma of a soggy rag.;No offense.
Do your arms always flail like that; or is it a dance?
You remind me of a malfunctioning probe from Cryon Delta.
If confusion were a lifeform, you’d be its ambassador.
Even your thoughts are disorganized.
I thought humans were smarter.;I was wrong.
I've met bacteria from Mars more decisive than you.
You're glowing; is that normal on Vortexia?
You're holding that pan like it's a philosophical question.
You spill more than a broken bismuth reactor.
I've seen gravity collapse less dramatically than your composure.
Do you always fumble with atoms, or is this a special occasion?
You're doing fine.;If the goal is disappointment.
I’m writing a report on primitive lifeforms.;You’re the cover image.
Your cooking smells like planetary regret.
Are you made of unstable oxygen isotopes?
You're lucky this station has insurance.
You act like you're from Zenthar.;That’s not a compliment.
Even black holes avoid your soup.
You speak like a confused refrigerator.
You look confused; has time betrayed you again?
I’d help you, but I don’t want to lower my IQ.
Your hands move like decaying iridium.
Do all humans wear their intelligence externally like that?

You're endearing.;In a disappointing way.
I’m still trying to decode your facial expressions.
You remind me of a failed robot chef on Jubilon.
Your emotional output is messier than a xenon explosion.

I’d roast you more, but you might burn for real.
You just violated a flavor law from Jubilon.
Did someone train you with broken utensils?
You're an inspiration.;To no one.
You wobble like a neutron in denial.
You smell like the fumes of carbon regret.
Do you do everything with this level of uncertainty?
Your cooking lacks direction; much like your life.
Your energy is very... boron-adjacent.
You’re the physical embodiment of static.
I’ve seen spoons with more ambition.
Don’t worry, I’ve lowered my standards.
You move like gravity’s not convinced you’re real.
You should see a neurologist; on Cryon Delta.
Are you confused, or just highly inefficient?
You radiate the charm of tepid boron tea.
That flavor choice was bold; and catastrophic.
You dropped the pan.;Symbolic.
Did you study culinary arts on Earth?;That explains a lot.
You just insulted that carrot.;It left.
This dish screams for help.;So do I.
You’re leaking failure again.
Your precision is like molten iridium; uncontrollable.
Your technique is unique.;And by unique, I mean incorrect.
I’ve seen sentient fog on Zenthar cook better.
Your seasoning is a war crime on Pluto.
Why is the soup reflecting your insecurities?
I sense an existential crisis; is it the garnish?
You confuse chaos with creativity.
The plating looks like neon decay.
I didn’t know Gloopiter had culinary schools.;Clearly, they don’t.
Your sense of timing rivals a broken clock in a wormhole.
You burned the sauce; and my hope.
You can’t measure taste in lightyears; but you tried.
Even the AI is cringing.
That meal looks like it’s asking to be forgotten.
Are you improvising, or rebelling against logic?
That flip was illegal in six galaxies.
I’m legally required to warn Xenovia about your cooking.
You made the blender sad.
The kitchen fears you now.
I'd say 'nice try', but Mars has honesty laws.
You're radiating 'first day' energy.
Your spatula technique is pure boron entropy.
I've seen bad; you're redefining it.
This dish violates at least 3 interplanetary ethics codes.
You’re the reason we invented robot chefs.
That meal might awaken the ghost of oxygen.
Is that steam or your soul escaping?
I’d applaud, but I respect food too much.
Congratulations.;You’ve confused the oven.
That smell?;It’s the universe crying.
Did you stir with a sample of radon?;Explains the instability.
You just created flavor entropy.
Your plating style is... gravitationally offensive.
Even the void rejects this presentation.
